# XLClass

 A Class I put together for working with Excel files using openpyxl for
 my common uses.  

Generates an Xlsx object with Openpyxl Workbook/Worksheet objects as
attributes for use with the enclosed methods.  

## Requirements for *.xlsx file support only

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements-xlsx_only.txt
```

## Requirements to also include *.xls file support
